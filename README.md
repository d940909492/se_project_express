# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. 
<br />
[And this is repo of front-end](https://github.com/d940909492/se_project_react)

<br />
<br />

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

<br />

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
